# Deep-Neural-Networks-for-image-classification

This is a capstone project I had to do after completeing the **Neural Networks and Deep Learning** course by deeplearning.ai from Coursera.
The python(.py) files are various util tools, like *sigmoid()* or *ReLu()* functions that I have made by myself and those have been imported in the Jupyter Notebooks(.ipynb) for use instead of  importing them from ready-made libraries like Tensorflow

The H5 files are for checking the test cases to see if the functions are working properly.

The Jupyter Notebooks contain the detailed explanation with the code for creating a Deep Neural Network and use that to classify a Dataset of images of Cats.
